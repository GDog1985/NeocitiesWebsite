# NeocitiesWebsite
Template for my neocities website. Available for anyone to use as a template for their own site. 

Nothing fancy here. This is a website I created on Neocities after talking with Chris Were on Destination Linux. Neocities is a free website service that is open source. Was a fun project to work on. You can unzip the files and upload or steal the bits of code as you see fit. 

Enjoy
