# NeocitiesWebsite
Template for my neocities website. Available for anyone to use as a template for their own site. 

Nothing fancy here. This is a website I created on Neocities after talking with Chris Were on Destination Linux. Neocities is a free website service that is open source. Was a fun project to work on. You can take the code from each of the pages and copy paste it into your site. Then edit the graphics and text to match your needs. 

Enjoy
